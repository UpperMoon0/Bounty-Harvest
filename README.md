Embark on an exciting journey with Bounty Harvest - a progression-based farming modpack! As you cultivate your farm, delve into the mines, forage for resources, and explore the vast landscapes, youâ€™ll find yourself leveling up and unlocking new possibilities.

Featuring over 155 quests that systematically guide you through various stages of the game.

The Bountiful mods allow you to monetize your efforts by selling your products for coins. These coins serve as a currency to level up and unlock a plethora of new elements including crops, animals, products, and items.

The game is set against the backdrop of a breathtaking and diverse wilderness landscape. Most of the content will eventually be integrated into the modpack progression, providing a cohesive gaming experience.

There are currently 7 playable levels, many more to come in the future!

Please note that as the modpack is in its early alpha stage, you may encounter several bugs and unintentionally ungated items. I appreciate your understanding and patience as we work towards refining Bounty Harvest. Your feedback during this phase is invaluable to us. Enjoy your journey!
